# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

General Idea:

This web app is focused on golf as it is a hobby that I am currently interested in. It will use data from different websites and store information using AWS. The theme is a mix of two main ideas: helping golfers choose the best time and place to play and compete with friends or local players through leaderboards (as of now, could be changed if I am not able to complete one). It will be a tool that helps golfers plan their rounds and stay connected with others in the golfing community.

What the App Will Do:

The app will help golfers decide when and where to play based on real-time information like weather, course conditions, and how busy courses are. It will pull in data from weather websites and, if possible, tee time or golf course websites. The app will create a score called a “Playability Index” (kind of like a handicap index) that shows how good the conditions are for playing at different courses near the user.
In addition to that, golfers will be able to log their scores, track their progress, and see how they rank compared to their friends or other local players. The app will have a leaderboard that updates regularly and shows who’s playing well nearby. This part of the app makes golf more fun and competitive, even for casual players. 
Together, these features make the app useful for both planning and tracking rounds.

Target Audience:

This app is for anyone who plays golf for fun, especially:
Casual golfers who want to find the best time to play.
Golfers who like to compete with friends and see how they’re improving.
People who want a more social or fun golf experience.


What Sort of Data Will It Manage:

The app will collect and manage several kinds of data that change over time or are added by users. These include:
User profiles: names, email, location, local/favorite courses, handicap level.

Golf scores: when and where someone played, how many strokes, and any extra notes.

Leaderboard data: rankings based on recent scores, filtered by course, age group, or friends.

Weather and course info: pulled in from outside sources to calculate the best times to play.

Playability Index scores: created by combining data from weather, course traffic, and user reviews, etc.

Stretch Goals:
Once the basic version is working, these are some stretch goals that could eventually be added:

Mobile app version: so golfers can use it easily on the course. 

Notifications: get alerts when it’s a great day to play, or when someone beats your score, etc.

Interactive maps: show course layouts and how each hole plays, with tips.
